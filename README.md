# ToggleModsGTA5
Toggle your mods on and off easily with one batch file in GTA V
<br>
**TO USE**
1. Install your mods!
2. Right click on the batch file & edit it
3. Change the file location at the top (next to the *cd*) to the location of your GTA install
<br>i. The included file location is steam's default, so if you didn't change it, don't worry!
4. Save the file
5. Running the batch file will turn mods on and off by renaming the main mods dependency
<br><br>This *most likely* works as intended, but I haven't tested with a bunch of mods, but in theory, it should work.
